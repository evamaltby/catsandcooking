            <p>      Having the correct equipment makes cooking a whole lot 
            easier. Make sure they are easily accessible and clean.
            Having other equipment like a peeler or a knife-sharpener 
            makes your cooking quicker and more tasty! If you need help deciding which
            equipment you need, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-av6cz9upO0" target="_blank">this</a> video from Gordon Ramsey.</p>
            
            <h2>Good Ingredients</h2>

            <p> Make sure you get the best ingredients you can afford.
            Markets are a great place to get good food and cheap prices.
            If not markets, authentic butchers, fishmongers and bakery's
            are also great places for hunting good food. To find your local food retailers click <a href="https://www.goodsixty.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a> for the UK or <a href="https://www.eatwellguide.org/" target="_blank">here</a> for the USA. Remember your
            
          
            butcher/baker/fishmonger will be happy to advise you and help
            you get the right ingredients for your dish(es). </p>
            
            <h2>Flavour</h2>
            <img src="Images/spicycat.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="A cat sniffing chilli">
            <p> No matter what you are cooking you always 
            want it to taste good. Seasining with a bit of salt 
            and pepper is a great way to add in a bit of flavour.
            Chilli, flakes or paste, is also a good way to pack a 
            punch in your dish just make sure that the chilli 
            flavour goes witht the rest of the ingredients. 
            If in doubt dont be scared to check on the internet (click <a href="https://www.eatright.org/food/planning-and-prep/cooking-tips-and-trends/enhancing-the-flavor-of-your-meals" target="_blank">here</a> to visit a website that might help) 
            and raid the cupboards for spices and condiments that 
            might just make your dish. </p>
            
            <h2>Keep a Cool Head</h2>

            <p> Although Gordon Ramsey
            </a> is one of the worlds greatest 
            chef's, he doesn't always have the best attitude. Keep a cool
            head in the kitchen to prevent mistakes. But remember
            that things don't always go right but they normally aren't
            ruined either.
